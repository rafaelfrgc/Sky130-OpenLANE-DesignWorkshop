# Day 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
## How to talk to computers 

This section is an introduction to computers and chips with related terms and concepts. It covers:
 1. Introduction to what is meant by a "chip", covering what are packages, like the QFN-48 Package, and the parts of a package like pads, core, die, IPs and foundries.  
 2. Introduction to RISC-V 
 This is an brief introduction to the contents of the course, talking about how a programming language is translated to hardware operations through compilation, HDLs, and layout of the chip, especiffically using the RISC-V ISA.
 3. From Software Applications to Hardware
 This topic talks about the process to execute a software application in a hardware chip, and the steps involved in the process, like the compiler, assembler and the OS. It also describes what is an ISA, the RTL description of the chip, the netlist synthesis and the physical design of the netlist.
